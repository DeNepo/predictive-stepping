# Predictive Stepping

Practice predicting each step of program execution, using your browser's debugger to check your predictions every step of the way.

## Learning Objectives

### The Browser's Debugger

- ü•ö **Stepping Through**: You can use the _Step_ button to go through a program
  one statement at a time, pausing an any line you want to inspect.
- ü•ö **Scope Panel**: You can use the _Scope_ panel in your debugger to find the
  value of all active variables at step of execution, including when a variable
  is _uninitialized_.
- ü•ö **Hovering Previews**: You can preview the value of any expression or
  initialized variable in your program, including parts of a longer expression.
- ü•ö **Breakpoints**: Once in the Debugger, you can set and unset breakpoints to
  skip ahead to specific lines. You can also set and unset breakpoints within a
  line when possible.
- ü•ö **Stepping Over**: You can step over functions in your program to skip
  their _implementation_ and focus on your program's behavior.
- üê£ **`debugger` Statement**: You understand the difference between `debugger`
  and a breakpoint, and can write a `debugger` statement in your source code to
  pause the program before specific lines.

### Debugging Workflows

- **Programs with `prompt/alert/confirm` interactions**:
  - ü•ö You can open, run, debug _and_ edit these JavaScript programs programs with Study Lenses.
- **Programs with HTML, CSS and DOM Interactions**:
  - ü•ö You can edit these programs in VSCode.
  - ü•ö You can open these programs' in the browser using a file path, LiveServer or Study Lenses.
  - ü•ö You run and debug these programs in the browser using your browser's devtools.

## During Class

Practice stepping through and predicting programs behavior using your browser's debugger.

### Before Break

- **All Together**:
  - Discuss the [Predictive Stepping](./predictive-stepping.md) study method.
  - A coach demonstrates the debugger features in `/1-isolate/examples`
- **In Small Groups**:
  - Practice stepping through and predicting the programs in
    `/1-isolate/exercises`

**Break!**

### After Break

- **All Together**:
  - A coach demonstrates how to step through JavaScript in an
    HTML project with `/2-integrate/examples`
- **In Small Groups**:
  - Practice stepping through and predicting the programs in
    `/2-integrate/exercises`
- **All Together**
  - Each group will share: What went well? What went less well? Lessons learned?
  - Discuss!
